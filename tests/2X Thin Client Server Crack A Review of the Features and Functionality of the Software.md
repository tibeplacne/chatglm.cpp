# How to Set Up a 2X Thin Client Server with Parallels RAS
 
A thin client server is a type of network architecture that allows multiple users to access a centralized computing resource, such as a virtual desktop or an application, from low-cost and low-power devices, such as thin clients or zero clients. Thin client servers can reduce hardware costs, improve security, and simplify management for organizations that need to provide remote access to their employees or customers.
 
One of the best solutions for setting up a thin client server is Parallels Remote Application Server (RAS), a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform that delivers virtual desktops and applications to any device, anywhere. Parallels RAS supports a wide range of thin client devices, including Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Chrome OS, Android, iOS, and Mac. Parallels RAS also offers a device management tool called Parallels RAS Device Manager (RASDM), which allows IT admins to configure, monitor, and control thin client devices from a single console.

In this article, we will show you how to set up a 2X thin client server with Parallels RAS in four simple steps:
 
1. Install Parallels RAS on your server.
2. Publish your virtual desktops or applications.
3. Install Parallels Client on your thin client devices.
4. Connect your thin client devices to your server.

## Step 1: Install Parallels RAS on your server
 
To install Parallels RAS on your server, you will need a Windows Server 2019 or later with at least 4 GB of RAM and 200 MB of disk space. You will also need a license key for Parallels RAS, which you can get from the official website or from your reseller. You can download the installation file from here: https://www.parallels.com/products/ras/download/
 
Once you have downloaded the file, run it as an administrator and follow the wizard instructions. You will be asked to choose the installation type (standard or custom), the components to install (Parallels RAS Console, Parallels RAS Publishing Agent, Parallels RAS Secure Client Gateway, etc.), and the license key. You will also be asked to create an administrator account and password for Parallels RAS.
 
After the installation is complete, you will see the Parallels RAS Console on your desktop. This is where you will manage your thin client server and publish your virtual desktops or applications.
 
## Step 2: Publish your virtual desktops or applications
 
To publish your virtual desktops or applications, you will need to have them installed on your server or on another server that is connected to your network. You can use any type of virtualization technology, such as Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware ESXi, Citrix XenServer, etc. You can also use physical machines or cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services.
 
To publish your virtual desktops or applications, open the Parallels RAS Console and go to Farm > Publishing. Click on Add and choose what you want to publish: a desktop session (full desktop), an application (single application), or a file (document or folder). You will then be asked to select the source (server or machine) where your desktop or application is located, the name and icon for your published item, and the users or groups who can access it. You can also configure advanced settings, such as display mode, security options, printing options, etc.
 
After you have published your virtual desktops or applications, they will appear in the Published Items list. You can edit or delete them at any time by right-clicking on them and choosing the appropriate option.
